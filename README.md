# AquaSafe Mobile App

**AquaSafe** LoRa-based mobile application designed to aid small-scale fishermen in challenging maritime environments. This app enables critical features such as offline communication, emergency SOS alerts, weather prediction, and fishing hotspot analysisâ€”all without the need for internet connectivity by depending on LoRa for long range connectivity and Bluetooth Low Energy for local device interaction.

## Key Features
- **Offline Communication:** Bi-directional chat system enabling communication among fishermen via the LoRa network.
- **Real-Time SOS Alerts:** Trigger emergency alerts in distress situations.
- **Weather Prediction:** Provides accurate rain predictions for the current and suggested hotspot locations.
- **Fishing Hotspot Analysis:** Analyze and identify optimal fishing locations.

## System Requirements

### Software Requirements
- Flutter SDK
- VS Code or Android Studio
- Java Development Kit (JDK): Recommended Version: Java 21
- Arduino IDE

### Hardware Requirements
- ESP32 Board configured as a BLE device
- Android Device with BLE support

## Installation

### Flutter Setup:
#### For Windows
 - Download Flutter SDK.
 - Extract the SDK to ```C:\flutter```
 - Set env variables by adding Flutter to PATH ```setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\flutter\bin"```

#### For macOS
- Install Flutter using Homebrew ```brew install flutter```

### Development Tools:
 - Use VS Code or Android Studio.
 - Install plugins for Flutter and Dart in your IDE.

### Android SDK:
 - Open Android Studio.
 - Go to Tools > SDK Manager.
 - Under SDK Tools, install:
   - Android SDK Command-line Tools
   - Android SDK Build-Tools

### Verify Installation (for both windows and macOS):
 - Run ```flutter doctor```

### Running the App:
 - Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/Lora-ResearchProject/AqueSafe_mobileApplication.git```
 - Get dependencies: ```flutter pub get```
 - Run the app: ```flutter run```
 - Set up an emulator or connect a physical device via USB.

## Bluetooth Connection & Configuration

### Bluetooth Connection:
- The app use ```flutter_reactive_ble``` package to bluetooth low energy.
- No manual pairing is required; the app automatically detects and connects when the ESP32 is advertising within range.

### BLE Configuration with ESP32:
- Get the [ESP32 BLE configuration code](https://github.com/Lora-ResearchProject/ESP32_MultiService_BLE.git) from the repository
- Open the .ino file in Arduino IDE.
- Connect Esp32 to the PC via USB
- Select Board as ESP32 Dev Module and appropriate COM port.
- Check UUID Synchronization : Ensure that the service and characteristic UUIDs defined in the ESP32 code match those in the AquaSafe mobile app's ```lib/utils/constants.dart file```.
- Compile and upload the code

### Verify BLE Server Advertising:
 - After uploading the code, use a BLE scanning tool (e.g., nRF Connect, ) or BLE-compatible device to check if the ESP32 is visible.
 - The ESP32 should advertise its BLE services as ESP32-MultiService.

### Connect the Mobile App:
 - Launch the AquaSafe mobile app and ensure it automatically connects to the BLE device.
