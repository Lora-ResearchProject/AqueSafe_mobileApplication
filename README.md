# AquaSafe Mobile App

**AquaSafe** is a cutting-edge, LoRa-based mobile application designed to aid fishermen in challenging maritime environments. This app enables critical features such as offline communication, emergency SOS alerts, weather prediction, and fishing hotspot analysisâ€”all without the need for internet connectivity.


## Key Features

- **Offline Communication:** Bi-directional chat system enabling communication among fishermen via the LoRa network.
- **Real-Time SOS Alerts:** Trigger emergency alerts in distress situations.
- **Weather Prediction:** Provides accurate weather forecasts tailored to the location of the fisherman.
- **Fishing Hotspot Analysis:** Analyze and identify optimal fishing locations.

## Installation

#### Flutter Setup:
 - Install Flutter SDK.
 - Ensure the environment variables are set correctly for flutter commands.

#### Development Tools:
 - Use VS Code or Android Studio.
 - Install plugins for Flutter and Dart in your IDE.

#### Android SDK:
 - Open Android Studio.
 - Go to Tools > SDK Manager.
 - Under SDK Tools, install:
   - Android SDK Command-line Tools
   - Android SDK Build-Tools

#### Verify Installation:
 - Run ```flutter doctor``` to ensure all components are installed correctly.

#### Running the App:
 - Clone the repository: ```git clone https://github.com/Lora-ResearchProject/AqueSafe_mobileApplication.git```
 - Get dependencies: ```flutter pub get```
 - Run the app: ```flutter run```
 - Optional: Set up an emulator or connect a physical device via USB.


## Bluetooth Connection 

 - The app connects to a hardware device via Bluetooth for data exchange
 - Supports built in bluetooth ensuring seamless BLE connectivity.
 - The mobile app automatically detects and connects to the BLE device when the ESP32 is configured and advertising within range.
 - This enables access to key features like SOS alerts, chat, fishing hotspots, weather updates, and GPS data without requiring manual pairing.


## Hardware Requirements

#### ESP32 Module:
 - Configured with BLE services and characteristics for communication.
 - Refer to the repository ESP32 MultiService BLE for detailed configuration and setup guide.

#### Power Supply:
 - Battery or USB-powered setup for ESP32 devices.
   
#### Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Connectivity:
 - Ensure the smartphone supports BLE and is configured to communicate with the ESP32 module.


## ESP32 Configuration

#### 1. Obtain ESP32 Configuration Code:
 - Get the [ESP32 BLE configuration code](https://github.com/Lora-ResearchProject/ESP32_MultiService_BLE.git) from the repository

#### 2. Compile and upload the code to the ESP32 device:
 - Open the .ino file from the repository in Arduino IDE.
 - Select the correct Board (e.g., ESP32 Dev Module) and Port under the Tools menu.
 - Get a new sketch and paste the code

#### 3. Check UUID Synchronization
 - Ensure that the service and characteristic UUIDs defined in the ESP32 code match those in the AquaSafe mobile app's ```lib/utils/constants.dart file```.
 - This alignment is essential for the app to interact correctly with the BLE device.
   
#### 4. Compile and upload the code to the ESP32 device.
 - After checking UUIDs match compile and upload the code in to ESP32

#### 5. Verify BLE Server Advertising:
 - After uploading the code, use a suitable mobile app, such as  (e.g., nRF Connect, ) or BLE-compatible device to scan for BLE devicesservers.
 - Ensure the ESP32 device (ESP32-MultiService) is visible and advertising the necessaryits services.

## Connect the Mobile App
 - Launch the AquaSafe mobile app and ensure it automatically connects to the BLE device.
 - The app should successfully retrieve data from the BLE services (e.g., GPS, SOS alerts).
